# weathersky -- weather alerts for Bluesky

## General overview

This program uses the National Weather Service's API to identify important weather watches and warnings, parse them into a reasonable short-message intended for actual humans, and then post them to the Bluesky social media network.

The first version of this program was built in some hours on Sept. 26, 2024, when Hurricane Helene was heading for Florida's coast and spawning lots of tornadoes. 

The second experimental pull of data showed a tornado heading for the author's house. Good times.

The initial version of this was built to publish tornado warnings, and only tornado warnings, to https://bsky.app/profile/NotNWSTornado.bsky.social . That is essentially intended as a parallel to the official National Weather Service short-messaging service at https://twitter.com/nwstornado . Bluesky lacked these warnings, but also fortunately largely lacks Nazis.

My hope would to begin publishing maps with some of these alerts, and to begin publishing significant alerts for each National Weather Service office as well. Will any of this happen? Did it already happen and I never updated the documentation?
